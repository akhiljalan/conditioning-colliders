# Conditioning Effects Lead to Spurious Correlations

This is a short illustrative blog post about selection bias and conditioning effects. You can follow along by cloning this repository and stepping through the Jupyter notebook. 

Key points: 
- Conditioning rules can induce spurious correlations
- Ordinary statistical tests like $p$-values don't avoid this problem 
- In higher dimensions, the opportunity for spurious correlations grows, and the strength of such correlation values increases as well. 

Overall, we illustrate the importance of careful attention to *every* step of the data pipeline, not just model training.
